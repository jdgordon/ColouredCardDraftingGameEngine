This is an implementation of the 7 wonders board game by Antoine Bauza.

TODO List:

* Implement Wonders
* Implement a UI - hopefully a textbased web design similar to the isotropic.org style
* Fix buying cards so the money is actually spent
* Leaders expansion
* Cities expansion
* Babel expansion!


To run the game just run $ ./game.py in the chceckout directory
